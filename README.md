A Web Scraper is a program that quite accurately scrapes or gathers data from websites. Letâ€™s take an imaginary example, where we might build a web scraper that would go to Twitter, and gather the content of tweets. At the micro-level, web scraping is simply the act of gathering data from the internet, in any form. However, at the large-scale level, web scraping allows you to collect data in large volumes by using bots. The bots, called crawlers or spiders, go through the source code of a given web page and tag data according to some present parameters. After this, the data extractor accumulates the attached data and extracts it into a spreadsheet file.
